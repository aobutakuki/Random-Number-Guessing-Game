# Random-Number-Guessing-Game

This project is a simple random number guessing game I made in order to learn more about random number generation and how it works. It also made me understand how to handle user input a little better.
The game difficult can be changed from Game.cpp, I am not actively working on this project and since it is mostly a learning experience, it is very likely the code might be a little bit confusing here and there and lack the perfect optimizations it should have. However it was a very interesting learning experience!

There are no requirements for running this game, the program was compiled on VS Community 2022.
